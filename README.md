The handy and all around fun bot that can be used for any kind of server!

 ## Commands and Features
 
 EdgyBot has lots of categories of commands.

* Fun Commands
* GD Commands (Geometry Dash Commands)
* Info Commands
* Music Commands
* Image Commands
* Crypto Commands
* Utility Commands
* Random Commands

EdgyBot is being developed for more categories, Image Commands as the newest addition.
We are also working on the Audio Categories, which is new, and is due to improvement.

## Self Hosting
While EdgyBot could be a great reference for Discord.Net Bot Developers, it's not a great bot for self hosting.
EdgyBot needs multiple Environment Variables and external connections to run.
